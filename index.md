# Matthew Lulgjuraj's First CS193 Homework

## Things I have to say that I love about CS193
- I like the supportive images added with overlayed subtext, creating a combined understanding to both send a message, and, at times, create humor.
<sub>_memes... I was talking about the memes._</sub>
- The lecturer is pretty good at lecturing; I think he has a name too, which is pretty cool. The lecturer genuine, and that's what I like.
- uhhh... I really like the chairs used in this class. There are pretty cool stairs in the room as well. Definitely my favorite things about CS193 right there.
- I also like how the person grading this is reading through all of this for no reason at all.
- Additionally, I like how I get to write this bullet point as a filler sentence that adds nothing to the assignment!



Wow! You read through all of that! As a reward: here's a video of a [kitten doing a backflip](https://bit.ly/KittenDoingABackflip) that I probably could've imported here directly... oh well.
